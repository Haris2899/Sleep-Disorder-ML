# 😴 Sleep Quality Prediction Model

A **Machine Learning** project designed to predict a user's **sleep quality** (rated on a scale of **1–10**) based on their **stress levels** 😫 and **behavioral observations** 🧠.  
The focus is on achieving **high prediction accuracy** through careful **feature selection** and **model evaluation**.
